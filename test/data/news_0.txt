The Environmental Protection Agency told workers on Friday that contracts with federal unions have been canceled, part of the Trump administration’s push to end collective bargaining agreements across the federal government.

In an agencywide email reviewed by The New York Times, E.P.A. officials said contracts with the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union for federal employees, and four other unions were “hereby terminated.”

The terminations at the E.P.A., which started the year with over 16,000 employees but planned to reduce its staff to close to 12,000, follow an announcement earlier this week that the Department of Veterans Affairs would strip labor protections for more than 400,000 of its workers. Last week, an appeals court authorized President Trump’s order instructing agencies to end collective bargaining agreements to move forward while challenges to the order played out in court.

That order, which Mr. Trump signed in March and framed as critical to protecting national security, was part of a sweeping effort to assert more control over the federal work force.

A spokeswoman for the E.P.A., Molly Vaseliou, said in a statement that the agency “is working to diligently implement President Trump’s Executive Orders” related to union workers.

Justin Chen, president of A.F.G.E. Council 238, which represents about 8,000 E.P.A. workers across the country, called the move “authoritarian” and said it would weaken the ability of the government to ensure clean air and water in the United States.

Mr. Chen said the unions intended to challenge the decision, adding, “We will see the administration in court.”
