Agreement about subject-matter presupposes in turn that those who are inter-
ested in extending knowledge of a particular field share in a common under-
standing about what is relevant to their subject and what ought to be excluded.
In reference to political philosophy, this means that the philosopher should be
clear about what is political and what is not. Aristotle, for example, argued in the
opening pages of the Politics that the role of the statesman (politikos) ought not to
be confused with that of the slave-owner or head of a household; the first was
properly political, the latter were not. The point that Aristotle was making is still
of vital importance, and the difficulties of preserving a clear notion of what is po-
litical form the basic theme of this book. Aristotle was alluding to the troubles
that the political philosopher experiences in trying to isolate a subject-matter
which, in reality, cannot be isolated. There are two main reasons for the difficulty.
In the first place, a political institution, for example, is exposed to impinging in-
fluences of a non-political kind so that it becomes a perplexing problem of ex-
planation as to where the political begins and the non-political leaves off. Secondly,
there is the widespread tendency to utilize the same words and notions in de-
scribing non-political phenomena that we do in talking about political matters.
In contrast to the restricted technical usages of mathematics and the natural sci-
ences, phrases like “the authority of the father,” “the authority of the church,” or
“the authority of Parliament” are evidence of the parallel usages prevailing in so-
cial and political discussions.
