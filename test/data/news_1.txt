A recently detained immigrant filed a potential class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration on Friday, denouncing the conditions inside holding cells at the main federal immigration offices in Manhattan as overcrowded and unsanitary.

The cells belong to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, at 26 Federal Plaza. They have drawn scrutiny as ICE has hastened the pace of arrests in New York City, with migrants filling the holding facility on the building’s 10th floor. In the past, the cells were used to hold migrants for just a few hours, but amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, migrants often remain there for days or for more than a week.

The lawsuit said that migrants often sleep on the concrete floor or sitting upright, lack access to legal counsel and are subjected to a “horrific stench” emanating from toilets next to where they sleep.

A video recorded by a migrant who sneaked in a cellphone last month appeared to confirm some of those complaints, as has recent reporting by The New York Times.

The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, a Peruvian immigrant who entered the United States in July 2022 and lives in New Jersey. He was arrested by ICE on Friday as he was leaving a routine appearance in immigration court, where he was facing deportation proceedings and applying for asylum after being charged with entering the country unlawfully.

Mr. Barco Mercado, a father of two, including a 3-month-old, is being held at 26 Federal Plaza, where the lawsuit said dozens of people were often crammed into a space that was just 215 square feet. His lawyers are seeking that a judge certify the suit as a class-action lawsuit.

“People are being deprived of their basic rights, facing medical neglect, and they lack access to adequate food and hygiene,” said Harold Solis, a co-legal director of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group representing Mr. Barco Mercado. “This cruel detention policy is immoral and inhumane.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The agency has denied claims of unsanitary conditions at 26 Federal Plaza, telling The Times recently that “overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false.” Agency officials have described the holding cells as temporary processing centers, not long-term detention facilities. They have used that designation to justify denying access to members of Congress who have sought to inspect the cells in recent months.

The 10th-floor cells hold undocumented immigrants arrested by agents at the city’s immigration courts, one of which is just two floors above the cells. Immigrants held there are typically processed and shuttled to detention centers elsewhere in the New York area or in other states, including Pennsylvania and Texas.

New federal data analyzed by The Times shows that about half of the more than 2,300 people arrested by ICE in the New York City area since Mr. Trump returned to office in January have been held at 26 Federal Plaza. Concerns about detention facility conditions have surfaced across the country as Trump officials race to find enough space to hold the migrants whom Mr. Trump wants to expel as part his mass deportation campaign.
