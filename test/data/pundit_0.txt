The ‘code talk’ for white guys party
There is a grim reality facing Democrats amid the hoopla about eye-popping victories in special elections and Donald Trump’s falling approval rating.

The Senate map is an absolute disaster for them. Don’t take my word for it: During an hour-long conversation at Harvard University last month, Tim Walz said he was “pessimistic” about the party’s chances to win back the chamber.

You don’t usually hear that type of open pessimism from top officials. But Walz got even more candid from there. He said that the national party had become so toxic that it dragged down Sen. Jon Tester’s re-election bid in 2024—to the point that Tester, a close friend, asked him not even to call during election season.

But what stood out for me beyond Walz’s dark assessment was how little he had to say about what “change” for Democrats should look like. In fact, he seemed relatively content with the status quo. Walz said the Democratic party’s policies “are good” and defended DEI initiatives. He summed up the party’s problems as mostly a matter of messaging. He encapsulated his view of national politics as a contest of superficial branding when he explained why Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate.

“I was on the ticket, quite honestly, ’cause I could code-talk to white guys watching football fixing their truck,” he said. “I could put them at ease. I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.’”

Such a remark certainly says a lot about Walz himself. But it also underscored something bigger: The party faces a dilemma around its future, but Democrats and their allied groups and policy apparatus remain deeply uncomfortable confronting it. If they don’t soon, it might not be just the Senate that’s at risk.

There is near-universal agreement among Democrats that the party needs to expand its tent and appeal to more moderate and independent voters. What’s far less clear is what exactly they are willing to do to make the Democratic label more palatable to those types of voters.

Under the Walz vision, the party doesn’t need to stake out more moderate cultural or policy positions. Rather, Democrats can get the job done if they put a candidate in a Carhartt jacket and get them to speak somewhat fluently about college football on a podcast with Theo Von.

It’s hard not to see the shortcomings of this approach. Walz embodied them, but his inclusion on the Harris ticket did little to stop the bleeding with white male voters. Yes, he may have been boxed in by an overcautious campaign structure. But when he was sent out there as the meat-eating, football-loving neighborhood dad, he had his flubs (pick-six, anyone?).

And that’s to be expected. After all, running candidates who look the part of purple and red America isn’t a panacea. Voters know when they’re being pandered to, and they don’t always like it.

Another option is to simply bank on voters being so turned off by Trump that they turn to you. This may have worked in certain contexts. But the record is fairly mixed. Ask Mitt Romney if Trump’s toxic politics eventually ruined him. Ask Barack Obama if the Republican “fever” ever broke.

And yet, if you survey Democrats now, these appear to be the predominant tactics the party is relying on to win back control of Congress. Thermostatic politics may work in the short term. But the fear in some quarters is that the thermostat won’t help if the house is on fire.

“This is hilariously stupid. If you’re trying to pick up moderate voters, the way to do it is to *be* more moderate. Drinking beer and driving trucks aren’t substitutes,” Lakshya Jain, cofounder and CEO of the election data analysis firm Split Ticket, wrote in response to Walz’s comments.

“Voters don’t care about candidate identity as much as Democrats insist they do.”
