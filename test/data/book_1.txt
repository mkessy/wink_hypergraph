At the same time, however, most of the great statements of political philosophy
have been put forward in times of crisis; that is, when political phenomena are
less effectively integrated by institutional forms. Institutional breakdown releases
phenomena, so to speak, causing political behavior and events to take on some-
thing of a random quality, and destroying the customary meanings that had been
part of the old political world. From the time that Greek thought first became fas-
cinated by the instabilities that afflicted political life, Western political philosophers
have been troubled by the wasteland that comes when the web of political rela-
tionships has dissolved and the ties of loyalty have snapped. Evidence of this pre-
occupation is to be found in the endless discussions of Greek and Roman writers
concerning the rhythmic cycles which governmental forms were destined to
follow; in the fine distinctions that Machiavelli drew between the political con-
tingencies that man could master and those that left him helpless; in the
seventeenth-century notion of a “state of nature” as a condition lacking the set-
tled relationships and institutional forms characteristic of a functioning political
system; and in the mighty effort of Hobbes to found a political science that
would enable men, once and for all, to create an abiding commonwealth that
could weather the vicissitudes of politics. Although the task of political philoso-
phy is greatly complicated in a period of disintegration, the theories of Plato,
Machiavelli, and Hobbes, for example, are evidence of a “challenge and response”
relationship between the disorder of the actual world and the role of the political
philosopher as the encompasser of disorder. The range of possibilities appears
infinite, for now the political philosopher is not confined to criticism and inter-
pretation; he must reconstruct a shattered world of meanings and their accompa-
nying institutional expressions; he must, in short, fashion a political cosmos out
of political chaos.
Although conditions of extreme political disorganization lend an added ur-
gency to the quest for order, the political theorist writing for less heroic times has
also ranked order as a fundamental problem of his subject-matter. No political
theorist has ever advocated a disordered society, and no political theorist has ever
proposed permanent revolution as a way of life. In its most elemental meaning,
order has signified a condition of peace and security that makes civilized life pos-
sible. St. Augustine’s overriding concern for man’s transcendent destiny did not
blind him to the fact that the preparations for salvation presupposed an earthly
setting wherein the basic requirements of peace and security were being met by
the political order, and it was this recognition that drew from him the admission
that even a pagan polity was of some value. The preoccupation with order has left
its mark on the vocabulary of the political theorist. Words like “peace,” “stability,”

“harmony,” and “balance” are encountered in the writings of every major theo-
rist. Similarly, every political inquiry is, in some degree, directed at the factors
conducive to, or militating against, the maintenance of order. The political philoso-
pher has asked: what is the function of power and authority in sustaining the
basis of social life? what does the preservation of order demand of the members
in the way of a code of civility? what kind of knowledge is needed by both ruler
and ruled alike if peace and stability are to be maintained? what are the sources of
disorder, and how can they be controlled?
At the same time, and with important exceptions, most political writers have
accepted in some form the Aristotelian dictum that men living a life of associa-
tion desire not only life but the attainment of the good life; that is, that human
beings have aspirations beyond the satisfaction of certain elemental, almost bio-
logic needs, such as domestic peace, defense against external enemies, and the
protection of life and possessions. Order, as Augustine defined it, contained a hi-
erarchy of goods, rising from the protection of life to the promotion of the high-
est type of life. Throughout the history of political philosophy, there have been
varying notions about what was to be included under order, and these have
ranged from the Greek idea of individual self-fulfillment, through the Christian
conception of the political order as a kind of praeparatio evangelica, to the mod-
ern liberal view that the political order has little to do with either psyches or
souls. Irrespectively of the particular emphasis, the preoccupation with order has
drawn the political theorist into considering the kinds of goals and purposes
proper to a political society. This brings us to the second broad aspect of the sub-
ject-matter: what kinds of things are proper to a political society and why?
In our earlier discussion of political philosophy and its relation to philosophy,
we touched very briefly on the notion that political philosophy dealt with public
matters. Here I should like to point out that the words “public,” “common,” and
“general” have a long tradition of usage which has made them synonyms for what
is political. For this reason they serve as important clues to the subject-matter of
political philosophy. From its very beginnings in Greece, the Western political tra-
dition has looked upon the political order as a common order created to deal with
those concerns in which all of the members of society have some interest. The con-
cept of an order that was at once political and common was stated most eloquently
in Plato’s dialogue Protagoras. There it was related that the gods gave men the arts
and talents necessary for their physical survival, yet when men formed cities, con-
flict and violence continually erupted and threatened to return mankind to a bru-
tal and savage condition. Protagoras then described how the gods, fearful that men
would destroy each other, decided to provide justice and virtue:

Zeus feared that the entire race would be exterminated, and so he sent Hermes to
them, bearing reverence and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the
bonds of friendship and conciliation. Hermes asked Zeus how he should impart jus-
tice and reverence among men:—Should he distribute them as the arts are distrib-
uted; that is to say, to a favored few only [or] . . . to all? “To all,” said Zeus; “I should
like them all to have a share; for cities cannot exist, if a few share only in the virtues,
as in the arts . . .”5
The “commonness” of the political order has been reflected both in the range
of topics selected by political theorists as proper to their subject and in the way
that these topics have been treated in political theory. It is seen in the basic belief
of theorists that political rule is concerned with those general interests shared by
all the members of the community; that political authority is distinguished from
other forms of authority in that it speaks in the name of a society considered in
its common quality; that membership in a political society is a token of a life of
common involvements; and that the order that political authority presides over is
one that should extend throughout the length and breadth of society as a whole.
The broad problem that is posed by these and similar topics comes from the fact
that the objects and activities that they treat are not isolated. The member of so-
ciety may share some interests with his fellows, but there are other interests that
may be peculiar to him or to some group to which he belongs; similarly, political
authority is not only one of several authorities in society, but finds itself compet-
ing with them on certain matters.
That the political inheres in a situation of intersecting considerations suggests
that the task of defining what is political is a continual one. This becomes more
evident if we now turn to consider another aspect of the subject-matter; namely,
political activity or politics. For the purposes of this study I shall take “politics” to
include the following: (a) a form of activity centering around the quest for com-
petitive advantage between groups, individuals, or societies; (b) a form of activity
conditioned by the fact that it occurs within a situation of change and relative
scarcity; (c) a form of activity in which the pursuit of advantage produces con-
sequences of such a magnitude that they affect in a significant way the whole
society or a substantial portion of it. Throughout most of the last twenty-five
hundred years, Western communities have been compelled to undergo drastic
readjustments to changes induced from both within and without. Politics as one
reflection of this phenomenon has come to be an activity expressive of society’s
need for constant readjustment. The effects of change are not only to disturb the
relative positions of social groups but also to modify the objectives for which in-
dividuals and groups are contending. Thus the territorial expansion of a society
may open new sources of wealth and power which will disturb the competitive
positions of various domestic groups; changes in the modes of economic produc-
tion may result in the redistribution of wealth and influence in such a way as to
provoke protest and agitation on the part of those whose status has been adversely
