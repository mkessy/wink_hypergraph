# Always Check Effect Documentation for Idiomatic Solutions

## Guideline

Before implementing any functionality, consult the Effect documentation to identify the most idiomatic Effect-based solution. Effect provides a rich ecosystem of interfaces, combinators, and patterns that are designed to work together seamlessly.

## Rationale

Effect is a comprehensive ecosystem that provides well-designed, type-safe solutions for common programming patterns. Using Effect's built-in solutions offers several advantages:

1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Effect's components are designed to work together, providing seamless composition and interoperability.
2. **Type Safety**: Effect's APIs are carefully typed to catch errors at compile time.
3. **Resource Safety**: Effect's resource management ensures proper cleanup and handling of resources.
4. **Testability**: Effect's design makes testing straightforward with built-in test helpers and mocking capabilities.
5. **Performance**: Effect's implementations are optimized for both runtime performance and memory usage.
